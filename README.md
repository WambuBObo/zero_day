#Adding a local repository to Github
In this repository, I am learning how to use a local machine and how to push contents in my local repository to Github.
I have learned how to initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
I used the command ~~git init -b main~~ to initialize the directroy zero_day as a Git repository

I have then created a README.md file using markdown format and are going to add, commit and push this file to the remmote repository in Github
